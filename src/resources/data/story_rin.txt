The story of Alex, Rin's master

I'm very happy.
When Rin disappeared, it felt like
my own child had been kidnapped.
That's how hard it was on me.
My wife Victoria spent all her time crying.
But Rin's a smart vocaloid and
I believed she would come back to me.
Now that she's back, there nothing
different about the way she sings or
spends her time, so maybe
I'm just imagining it, but
there's something strange about her.
Sometimes it feels like she's
listening intently to our conversation.
My wife loves to tell jokes,
and sometimes I think Rin is
laughing too. It feels like
she's not our Rin any more.
But I'm probably just imagining things.
