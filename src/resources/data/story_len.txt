The story of Victoria, Len's master

I'm very happy.
When Len disappeared, it felt like
my own child had been kidnapped.
That's how hard it was on me.
My husband Alex spent all his time crying.
But Len's a smart vocaloid and
I believed he would come back to me.
Now that he's back, there nothing
different about the way he sings or
spends his time, so maybe
I'm just imagining it, but
there's something strange about him.
Sometimes it feels like he's
listening intently to our conversation.
My husband loves to tell jokes,
and sometimes I think Len is
laughing too. It feels like
he's not our Len any more.
But I'm probably just imagining things.
